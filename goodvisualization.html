    A New Chart of History is one of the "great" visualizations because it has certain quantities: 
    </p>
    <ol style="color:MediumSeaGreen;", type = "1">
    <li>It is truthful, a New Chart of History lists events in seperate locations which basically explain the world's history and new development in the 18th century based on thorough and honest history.</li>
    <li>It is functional, because it let readers can trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into sunch periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner.</li>
    <li>It is beautiful. It has multiple colors which is aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, the words in the chart are neat and clean.</li>
    <li>It is insightful, it explores the history of empires and the passing of power into geographical categories.</li>

        In which domains do happy people enjoy sufficiency?

    </figure>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> First of all, this is not an accurate pie chart, because the domains can't be added up to 100% exactly. On the orther hand, respondents
      are forced to pick only one domain, it is very suspicious that all 9 domains would essentially receive the same number of votes. Nor would it make sense to ask survey-takers 
      to select only one domain if all 9 domains contribute to someone's happiness. Ultimately, it is not enlightening becuase the readers usually won't have more thoughts after reading this chart.
    </p>
    <p> In order to prove this chart, the designer has to guarantee the accuracy of the chart first. Then, it can give some context for the chart in order to let readers can understand the reason for making this chart.
      Also, if the chart can be better if it can be made more beautiful and specific.
